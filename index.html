		<h2>What I'm working on</h2>
		<p>
			I am trying to learn Cyber Security, but I am interested in exploring various topics from programming to machine learning.

            So far programming is the hardest part of my second year of studies.
            PYTHON, HTLM, CSS and JS. JS is by far the hardest
